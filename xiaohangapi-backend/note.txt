using Mysql
using Mybatis:
        MyBatis-Plus, a popular ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for Java.
        generate the entity from sql

entity folder:
        @TableId:
            annotated field is the primary key of the database table.
        type = IdType.AUTO:
            Specifies that the primary key will be auto-incremented by the database
                Benefits:
                    Reduces the need for manual ID management in your code.
                    Ensures that IDs are unique and sequential (depending on the database configuration).
        @TableLogic:
            Used to enable logical deletion in MyBatis-Plus.
            Instead of physically deleting a record from the database,
            MyBatis-Plus updates the value of this field to indicate that the record is "deleted."
            Implements soft (logical) deletion, modifying the behavior of DELETE operations.
        @TableField(exist = false):
             Excludes a field from being mapped to the database, typically used for transient fields or constants.

 Client sdk:
        The client project acts as a bridge between the developerâ€™s application and the API, reducing development effort,
        ensuring security, and providing a standardized way to interact with the API.
        It ensures that the API is as easy to use as calling a local method.
