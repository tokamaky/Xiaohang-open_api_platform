## Project Overview

This project is an API open platform designed to provide developers with efficient, secure, and user-friendly API services. By leveraging modular design and technical integration, the platform supports API management, user permission control, usage analytics, and more, delivering a seamless experience for both developers and administrators.

### Features

1. **User Features**:
   - User registration, login, and management.
   - Enable or disable API access permissions.
   - View API usage statistics.

2. **Administrator Features**:
   - Manage APIs with CRUD operations.
   - Publish, deprecate, or debug APIs.
   - Control API access and rate limits.

3. **API Call Features**:
   - Provide high-performance API calls.
   - Track and analyze API usage, with statistics by user and API.
   - Secure API access with signature-based authentication to prevent malicious use.

4. **Technical Support**:
   - Lightweight client SDK to simplify API integration for developers.
   - Auto-generated API documentation and debugging tools using Swagger and Knife4j.

### Project Structure

The project adopts a modular design and is divided into the following five submodules:

1. **xiaohangapi-backend**:  
   Core module responsible for API management, calls, and analytics.
   - Provides CRUD operations for APIs.
   - Manages user permissions and API access.
   - Analyzes API usage data.

2. **xiaohangapi-client-sdk**:  
   Client SDK module to facilitate API integration with minimal effort.
   - Provides standardized API call interfaces.
   - Simplifies signature handling and response processing.

3. **xiaohangapi-common**:  
   Common module for shared functionalities and utilities.
   - Includes model definitions, constants, logging, and validation utilities.
   - Supports request and response conversions.

4. **xiaohangapi-gateway**:  
   Gateway module for unified API entry and routing.
   - Handles traffic control, circuit breaking, and rate limiting.
   - Validates request parameters and signatures.

5. **xiaohangapi-interface**:  
   Interface module showcasing available APIs and providing interactive debugging tools.
   - Offers API documentation and interactive call pages.
   - Enhances parameter construction with a built-in JSON editor.

### Key Highlights

1. **Efficient Collaboration**:  
   Auto-generated API documentation with Swagger and Knife4j, along with front-end plugins for request code generation, reduces front-end and back-end collaboration overhead.

2. **Enhanced Security**:  
   Implements signature-based authentication with unique Access Key and Secret Key for each user, ensuring secure and traceable API calls.

3. **Lightweight SDK**:  
   Developed a Spring Boot Starter-based SDK enabling API calls with minimal configuration, avoiding dependency conflicts and enhancing development experience.

4. **Performance Optimization**:  
   High-performance communication between modules using Dubbo reduces redundancy and increases system efficiency.

5. **User Experience**:  
   Provides interactive API documentation, online testing tools, traffic protection, and detailed analytics, ensuring system stability and user satisfaction.

### Advantages

- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of responsibilities through layered modules, ensuring maintainability and scalability.
- **Modern Technology Stack**: Integration of mainstream frameworks balancing performance, efficiency, and usability.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Comprehensive documentation and tools simplify the development process and lower the learning curve.
